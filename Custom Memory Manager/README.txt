To compile and execute the project, please extract all the files into a single folder.
Then, simply type make

You can change number of processes in simulation by changing the value of numProcesses at Line 43 in main.cpp
Changing Memory sizes and Cycles can be done at Lines 88 and 89 respectively in main.cpp
You can also comment line 94, if you want to put very large number of processes in simulation and are tired of waiting :)
Changing value of variable iterations in line 46, would change the number of times the simulation is performed.
